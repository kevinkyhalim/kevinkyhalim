I'm a technology enthusiast aspiring for a tech role dealing with data.

Over the past few years, I have learned various skills &/ tools for data analytics, engineering and scientist. Recently I have also delved into cloud computing & architecting to ensure that solutions can be quickly deployed and scaled for others to use.

Outside of tech, I like to keep myself active by hiking in mountains, diving under the sea, dancing on the ballroom or hanging from climbing walls.
